# Hard Sphere Collision Tests

This repository holds some simulations that are run using the `bigbang` crate. 


# How to Run

To run the circular orbit simulation, run `cargo run --release --bin=circular_orbit`. Likewise, to run the galactic orbit simulation, run `cargo run --release --bin=galactic_orbit`. The constants pertaining to the number of rounds and number of particles are defined at the top of each file so you can tweak them.
